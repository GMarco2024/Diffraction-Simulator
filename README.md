The purpose of this project, is to convert a mathematica code into swift in the form of a macOS application.
The mathematica source code can be found in this repository as a .swift file called "Mathematica Source Code".
The mathematica code itself was provided by Dr. Daniel M. Kaplan and Dr. Derrick C. Mancini during a course
called "IPRO 497: Antimatter Interferometer" under their instruction. I, along with several others, worked together
on interpreting the mathematica code to optimize it. I continued when the course ended by converting it into a macOS application
for practice (still in progress). All work is cited accordingly.
